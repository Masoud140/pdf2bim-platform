# Next session — resume here

**Last updated:** 2026-10-25 (P0.2 → P2, P3a, P3b, the P3c load cases and the AS 5100.2 combinations done; P3c close-out next).

**Rule:** read this file first, then `CURRENT_STATUS.md`. Then:
1. `git fetch`;
2. compare the branch heads below with the remote;
3. check for uncommitted work;
4. resume from the last verified checkpoint.

If this file and the repository disagree, the repository wins: fix this file. **Working mode:** autonomous (ADR-018). Ask the owner only about safety, validity, licensing or irreversible actions.

## 1. Last verified checkpoint

| Item | Value | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Working branch | `p3-model` (from `p2-sections` @ `e476e99`); P3b continues on it | `git branch -vv` |
| Head | `git log -1 origin/p3-model`; must equal the local HEAD | `git ls-remote` |
| Tests (executed 2026-10-24) | full suite on `0e99431`: 35 scripts, 368 / 368 assertions PASS; 18 print-only ran | `baseline/BR13A/test_run.md` |
| Dashboard build | unchanged since v45 (sha256 `710b259d2c7117d0…`) | no `src` / `base` change |
| Full suite record | `baseline/BR13A/test_run.md` (commit `0e99431`) | executed 2026-10-24 |

## 3. Next actions

1. **P3c close-out: girder and headstock responses**, on `p3-model`:
   - extend `pdf2bim/model/responses.py` with composite-girder section actions at both element ends (sagging M, V, T, N — exact with the fixed-end forces) and sill (headstock) actions (My, Vz, Mz, Vy, T at element ends, with the position along the sill);
   - envelope them through `combinations.combined_actions` (the traffic influence and the RSA use the response set automatically);
   - cross-check against the dashboard's `rxQdef` girder ("G") and headstock ("H") quantities: the fixture `tests/model/fixtures/br13a_dashboard_combinations.json` has only bearings and piles, so extend `tools/dump_dashboard_combinations.js` (keep it compact) — note the dashboard's GM1 = f[4] + L f[2] ignores the member load on the element (check before comparing);
   - write a combined-action schedule (bearings, piles, girders, sills) to `projects/BR13A/model/` with the governing rows and the provisional / unverified labels.
2. Then the P3 acceptance items: MIDAS import test (owner, X-2); P4 plan (concurrent actions, signed earthquake, independent MIDAS model).
3. Keep the generality guard green (local pre-commit hook, see CHANGELOG 2026-10-25). Full suite ≈ 45 min (`tools/run_suite.py`); don't edit tested files while it runs.

New in P3c combinations (for reference):
- `pdf2bim/model/combinations.py` (`Register`, `generate`, `combine`, `primitives`, `combined_actions`), `pdf2bim/model/responses.py` (`ResponseSet`); earthquake RSA and `traffic.Influence(responses=...)` use the response set;
- standards `AS5100.2:combination:*` (6 entries, unverified);
- tools `dump_dashboard_combinations.js` (compact fixture; `RAW=1` for the full dump), `compare_frozen_combinations.py`; test `test_combinations.py` (27).
- A BR13A combined-actions run takes ≈ 90 s (traffic sweep + RSA dominate).

## 4. Do not

- Do not mark any standards value `checked` / `approved`. Only the owner or the reviewers they nominate may, with an authorised copy (ADR-009).
- Do not copy clause text from the Standards. Store clause references and the minimum numbers only.
- Do not change dashboard engine code without re-running the baseline (T1 exact).
- Do not merge, force-push or delete branches.

## 5. Open items for the owner (non-blocking)

- **D-3:** girder end region (uB 1.17, uL 3.97 at x = 0.75 m; no solid-end zone defined).
- **BR13A 0.2 migration:**
  - the unit of D-6's original 34950 (probably mm);
  - significance levels for high-impact values.
- **H-2:** plots drawn with NaN coordinates (fix now or later).
- **D-34 … D-38:**
  - accept the BR13A support-line bearing (44.029166°), the 13 Super-T shape rows (incl. ttf 90) and the cross girder 800 × 1065;
  - replace the haunch (Assumed 0 mm);
  - confirm the 2000 END DIAPHRAGM reading (Task B-1).

- **D-39 … D-41** (P3b): sill setout, elastomer layer 12 mm (Assumed), bearing seat RLs (girder assignment by order).
- **F-5:** bearing positions — abutment drawings vs GA girder setout, 50–530 mm apart. Which is right?
- **F-6:** seat-to-soffit gap 100–127 mm vs the Assumed 150 mm bearing height.
- **MIDAS import test** of `projects/BR13A/model/BR13A.integrated.mct` (checklist `.mct.md`); a native export with one nodal load, one point spring and one elastic link would remove the unverified syntax (X-2).
- **H-3:** the dashboard's modal / earthquake mass double-counts the deck strips (+9.8 %): fix in the dashboard now, or leave it until P3c replaces that analysis?
- **H-4 / H-5 (traffic, dashboard):**
  - the default lane layout is never swept (G4 M ×1.33, outer bearings up to ×3.15);
  - the one-node bearing "lines" overstate inner-bearing reactions (up to +44 %) and understate girder moments (1–6 %).

  Were any dashboard traffic results already used outside the platform?
- **M-3:** temperature / shrinkage restraint forces at the fixed abutment are sensitive to the bearing idealisation. The restraint-block / dowel detail would settle the bearing model.
- **M-4:** combined minimum at bearing A-G4 is uplift on the P3b model (ULS −162 kN, SLS −37 kN), mostly from the Assumed shrinkage (300e-6) through the fixed-abutment restraint. Check in MIDAS / with the bearing detail.
- **Earth-pressure fill category** (controlled fill SOc or other SOo): not in the description; the combinations use SOo (provisional).

  Once these are settled, geometry, sections and the model are no longer provisional.
